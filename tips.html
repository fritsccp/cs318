        <h3>Travel can be stressful, for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be preempted. Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you should do these things:</h3>
        
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while you're gone.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase gets lost, your mouth feels it first.</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Clean everything, so that no one can enjoy it while you're gone</h3></li>
                </ul>
